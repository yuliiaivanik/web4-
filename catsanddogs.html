    <h1>Pets are an especially personal thing. They come in all shapes and sizes: from fluffy rabbits to wrinkly tortoises and restless hamsters. Some people love cats, others prefer dogs. Big or small, young or old, cute or ugly; one thing they all have in common is the hugely important role they play in everyday life.</h1>

  <p>3 unusual facts about dogs
    <ol>
   <li>Origin of dogs. Even in the middle of the 18th century, domestic dogs were considered a separate biological species. Later, scientists attributed them to one of the subspecies of wolves. At the same time, it is believed that this subspecies disappeared from the wild thousands of years ago. But European and American wolves are only distant relatives, despite the fact that their DNA matches the DNA of dogs by 99%.</li>
   <li>Character traits of dogs. Scientists have identified five main character traits characteristic of four-legged pets - sociability, curiosity, playfulness, aggressiveness and tendency to chase.</li>
   <li>Dogs are optimists and pessimists. Dogs, like people, can be optimistic or pessimistic, but rather have a corresponding view of the world. Scientific studies were conducted in which animals were asked to find food with different chances of a successful outcome. As a result of observations, it was established that some dogs continued to explore the place where the chance of finding food was 50:50, while the other part of the animals did not want to use the opportunity offered to them.</li>
